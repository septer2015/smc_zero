# smc-zero

SMC backtest foundation with a strict three-timeframe hierarchy: **D1** = global bias, PDH/PDL
and major order blocks; **H1** = working structure (BOS/CHoCH), premium/discount and sessions;
**M15** = entry zone (sweep -> CHoCH -> entry into an M15 FVG/OB inside the H1 zone). M5 and H4
are intentionally not used.

Time convention: the `datetime` column in `./data/*.csv` (M15/H1/D1) is an **open_time** stamp
(UTC-naive, localized to UTC), so `close_time = timestamp + bar period`. The last bar of every
timeframe is treated as still forming and dropped by default (`drop_unclosed=True`) to avoid thin
lookahead on the live edge.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Checks

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

SMC indicator/strategy logic is not implemented yet - see the documented stubs under
`src/smc_zero/indicators`, `strategy`, `backtester` and `utils`. Data files live in `./data/`.
